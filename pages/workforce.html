                -Behram Kapadia, Vice Chairperson (Management)
                    Known amongst the high circles as ‘the backbone of Malhar’, 
                    Administration is the department that essentially lays the edifice of every event as well as the fest in its entirety. 
                    The oil that keeps this massive Malhar machinery running smoothly, 
                    Administration is the first frontier of Malhar, the premier point of contact between the participants and the festival. 
                    From inviting colleges to bidding them adios post the fest and everything in between is what forms Administration’s portfolio. 
                    On the days of the fest, you will find this efficient bunch discreetly handling vital documents and 
                    closely observing the proceedings from their fortress of LR 14, venturing out only to handle pressing issues.
                    Welcome to Admin, the backstage of Malhar!

               <p>Assistance is the department that deals with crowd and venue management within college. 
               We take care of participants, audience and even other volunteers at times xD. 
               We keep the commotion to a minimum and make sure all Malhar events run smoothly. 
               Aside from crowd control we also have the privilege of dealing with all the judges that come for Malhar. 
               Basically, we work behind the scenes to make sure that everything runs smoothly. 
               Being the second largest department, Assistance is divided into 4 sub-departments - Judges, Halls, Floors and Foyer.

               <p>Logistics is more than what the name suggests. We are divided into 4 sub-departments - Constructions, Displays, Classrooms, and Events. Constructions are responsible for the Malhar stage that you just can’t miss in the first quad. Displays are in charge of the huge sponsor drop-downs. Classrooms set up the layouts for over 50 classrooms. Events deals with the logistical set up of events in the Foyer, Hall, First Quad, and School building as required. In spite of having over 90 volunteers, we will never fail to make you feel like a part of this family, with a bond like no other!

               <p>Westeros had the Night's Watch, Hogwarts had Dumbledore's Army, Earth has the Avengers, and Xavier's? Xavier's has Team Security. The department which everyone thinks is strict and harsh, but in reality we’re soft and kind. We at Security are always regarded as a bunch joyless souls whose sole purpose is to suck the life out of the fest, but behind the curtain, Security is not just a group of people working together to ensure the event continues to run, but rather a family, sharing a wealth of experiences and memories and a near unbreakable bond. They say home is where the heart is, and security is the heart of Malhar.

               <p>Malhar being round the corner, the pursuit to find the perfect department begins and if you're looking for a hard wired department to shake things up, Texxx is definitely the place to be. Texxx is the reason Malhar is Lit -literally and yes when it comes to sound, we're 'All About that Bass'. Be it the biggest or smallest events happening in either the Quad, Halls, Foyer and Classrooms, Texxx handles all the audiovisual and lighting needs. This, of course, can't be managed without Inventory, Mobiles and VSM, the very backbone of our department, who've got it all covered. Even though there might be days when the department gets tiring and time-consuming, it’s the volunteers, old and new that make this department inviolable. So if you've got the Texxx factor then come join us for a ‘Texxceptional’ Malhar Experience
